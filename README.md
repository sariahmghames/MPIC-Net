## Deep Pi Harvester project

This project aims at learning an automated harvesting task by collecting dataset from a human expert mounted with a sensorized setup on one arm.
The netwrok architecture features two modules:
* a feedforward network
* a model predictive impedance controller

This repo is a WIP and depends on 3 packages:
* net
* ros_myo
* yostlab_imu
  
clone ros_myo and yostlab_imu separately and add them to this repo

We use transfer learning  from the MPNet work: https://github.com/ahq1993/MPNet
